# Homework: Objects

Objects of type `Date` have a method called `getDay` that returns the
day of the week as a number, where `0` is Sunday, `1` is Monday, `2` is
Tuesday, and so on. For this assignment, your task is to write a
`weekday` function that takes a `Date` object, and returns the
corresponding day of the week.
