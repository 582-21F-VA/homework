# Homework: Collections

Implement the functions described below. For each one, choose the most
appropriate type of collection to use (array, set or map).

- A function named `greeting` that returns the appropriate greeting
  given a language from the following list: hello (English), hola
  (Spanish), こんにちは (Japanese), здравствуйте (Russian), नमस्ते
  (Hindi), merhaba (Turkish), sawubona (Zulu). If the given language is
  not in the list, the function should return "bonjour".

- A function named `duplicateCharCount` that returns the number of
  repeated characters in a given string. The `split` method can be used
  to divide a string into substrings using a given separator. The
  `length` property gives the length of an array, while `size` gives the
  size of a set.

- A function named `addEvent` that adds an event to a calendar. The
  function should take as arguments the calendar, the name of the event,
  and its date. It should return an updated copy of the calendar.
