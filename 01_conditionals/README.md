# Homework: Conditionals

For this assignment, your task is to implement the functions described
below.

- A function named `resellValue` that calculates the resell value of a
  vehicule based on its original price and how old it is. If the vehicle
  is less than 3 years old, it resells for 80% of the original price. If
  it is more than 10 years old, it resells for 50% of the original
  price. If the vehicle is at least 3 years old but not older than 10
  years, it resells for 70% of the original price.

- A function named `isPasswordValid` that validates a given password. To
  be valid, passwords must have at least 8 characters, one of which must
  be a question mark or an exclamation point. If a criterion is not met,
  your function returns a string describing the error. Otherwise, it
  returns an empty string.
