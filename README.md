# Homework

All homework assignements must be submitted in your own `homework`
repository (i.e., not the one your are currently in), in a directory
named according to the name of the homework (e.g., '01_setup'). To
upload a directory using GitHub's web interface, click on the `+` button
(to the left of the green `Code` button), choose the `Upload files`
option, select the directory you wish to upload, and click on `Commit
changes`.
